Welcome to the Metrix app. With the help of Metrix you can record, track, measure, and compare all your personal performance data.

Have you ever wondered how your sleep affects your work productivity? Or how your stress impacts your exercise performance? Metrix will show you how.

First up is your dashboard. 

<Image of the dashboard with blank data>

The graph at the top of the screen will display your data on a line chart. To begin with there will only be a single metric titled 'Default Data'. You can rename it at any time.

You also have your first category, titled 'Dashboard'. Categories are collections of metrics that can be used to display multiple sets of data across a single line chart. 
This will give you an opportunity to identify connections and patterns in your data.

You can't rename the dashboard category, but you'll get the chance to create your own soon.

<Image of the date selection bar>

Underneath the chart, the date selection bar will allow you to bring up data within a selected range. 
Currently you can only view as far back as the first date in your history, but we have plans to allow users to backdate their data in future versions of Metrix.
To select your chosen dates, enter them into the 'start date' and 'end date' boxes using the MM/DD/YY format. Then press the 'go to date' button.
Your chart will then display its contents between the start and end dates.
Hover over the chart on a specific day (or tap if you're on a mobile device) and the chart will display a list of the displayed data for that day.

At the bottom of your screen you will see the 'Quick Update' bar. Open it by clicking on it.

Inside this bar you will see all your current metrics listed along with a data entry field. To add a data value for the current day, enter it into the entry field and click the 'add' button. The chart will update immediately to show your new data.

Below the quick update bar, the 'recent activity' bar contains a list of the last 7 days and the data for any metrics entered on that day. Open it by clicking on it.

To jump to a specific day and view the activity chart for that day, click on the box containing the day and its data. 
Or enter a range of days using the date selection tool contained inside the recent activity bar and click on the 'go to date' button.

Lastly is the 'add data' bar. Open it by clicking on it.

This bar contains everything you need to add a new metric for measurement. Enter the name of your new metric and if you want to enter data for a specific day straight away, you can add that as well.
You can also select a data type. Currently Metrix allows users to measure data in a scale from 1-10 or as an integer (number). More data types are planned for later versions.
To tell your metrics apart you will want to select colours for them. Use the colour picker to do this and click 'track new metric' to add your new metric to the list.

You can also add categories to group your data together. Enter a name for your category and click the 'track new category' button to add one.

To see a list of your data and categories, open the sidebar menu by clicking the menu button in the top left corner of your screen. To close the menu, click outside the sidebar or click 'navigation' along the top of the sidebar menu.

The top button on the menu will return you to the dashboard at any time.

The button below will take you to your journal where you can view notes you've written about a specific day.

Below the journal button is a list of your categories. 

And below your categories is a list of all your metrics.

Click on one of your categories and you will be taken to the page for that category.

You will notice the layout is mostly the same as your dashboard. The only difference is the 'add/remove metric' bar at the bottom of the screen. Open it by clicking on it.
Here you can select which metrics from your list you wish to display in the selected category. 
Once you're done selecting your metrics, click the 'add/remove' button and the chart will update.
If you've selected metrics with different data types, you'll notice the chart now has 2 axes displaying those data types.
Below the chart the legend allows you to hide or display each metric by clicking on its name.

Underneath the 'add/remove metric' bar is the 'history' bar. Open it by clicking on it.

<Image of the history bar>

The history bar displays a list of collapsible boxes for each of your metrics. Open one by clicking on it.
The box that opens up will display the name of the selected metric, the averages of the data for that metric between the selected dates, and a list of your data seperated by day.

Return to the sidebar and select a metric.

<Image of the metric page>

The metric page will display a single metric and its data for you to view.

To rename a metric, click the 'edit' icon next to the title.

Enter a new title into the entry field and click the 'confirm' button to rename the metric.

As with the category page, the metric page contains the same chart you will already be familiar with.

At the bottom of the screen, the 'add data' bar allows you to enter a value and choose the day for that value to be assigned to, so you can go back and edit previous days if you need to. However, you cannot currently edit days before the first entry in the app. This option is planned for later versions.

The 'colour' bar lets you select a new colour for your metric. To change colour, select your new colour and click the 'add measurement' button in the 'add data' bar.

The 'set goal' bar allows you to add a goal to work towards for each metric. To add a goal enter a value into the entry field and click the 'set goal' button. Once set your goal will be displayed as a ring containing a number by the title. 
Entering a value for the current day will measure your progress against your goal and display as the ring filling with a green colour. You will also be able to see your current progress compared to your goal as measured by the numbers inside the ring.

The 'add note' bar allows you to add extra information to the current day's entry. In later versions it is planned to allow for notes to be added to previous days.

The 'history' bar acts the same as the version you've already seen on the category page.

Lastly, the 'correlation' bar allows you to directly compare the currently displayed metric with another. Select the metric you wish to compare with and click the 'add/remove' button. The bar will display two history boxes for the selected metrics. It will also provide a value for the correlation between the two metrics, so you can see if they share any pattern in their relationship. Values range from Very Low to Very High.
